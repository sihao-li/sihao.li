I am an economics student (a normalien) at the École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay and a lecturer at the Groupe IONIS (XP), focusing on the economics and sociology of cultural industries. I founded the "_Keynes, History, Politics, and (Macro)economics_" seminar at ENS Paris-Saclay to promote interdisciplinary discourse. Presently, I am furthering my research as an intern at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics (ENSAE/X), concentrating on Computational Social Science. My scholarly interests are broad, encompassing macroeconomics, digital economy and sociology, cultural and creative industries, and computational social science. Additionally, I am an active member of the editorial committee for the journal "_Regards croisés sur l'économie_" and a member of the AREFE.

Prior to my current endeavors, I served as a Teaching Assistant at Lycée Suger in Saint-Denis. Additionally, I was a Research Assistant at Labex ICCA (Campus Condorcet), working under the supervision of Fabrice Rochelandet. In this role, I engaged in a Contingent Valuation project.
